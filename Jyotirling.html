        <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;padding-right: 20px;color: #808080">The creation date of the temple remains unknown, but at present the temple was renovated by Late Gulshan Kumar in 1996. Thousands of pilgrims visit the temple every year to seek blessings from the Lord Shiva who is worshipped here in the form of ‘Nagdev’.

        <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;padding-right: 20px;color: #808080">As per the Shiv Purana, a demon named Daruka was blessed by Goddess Parvati, who was a wife of Lord Shiva. Misusing her blessings, Daruka tyrannized the local people and imprisoned a Shiva devotee named Supriya along with some other people.</p>
        <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;padding-right: 20px;color: #808080">On advice of Supriya, everyone started chanting the Shiv Mantra to save themselves from Daruka. Seeing this, Daruka raged in anger and ran to kill Supriya, when suddenly Lord Shiva in the form of Jyotirlinga appeared to protect her and other devotees. Since then, the Jyotirlinga is revered here in the Nageshwar Temple.</p>

        <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;padding-right: 20px;color: #808080">According to the mythological legends, Lord Shiva appeared in the form of an endless pillar of fire to stop Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma from their ongoing battle for supremacy. Seeing the pillar, Vishnu and Brahma set off in different directions to find the end of the pillar.</p>
        <p class="para" style="text-align: justify;padding-right: 20px;color: #808080">While both could not find the ends, Lord Brahma lied to have found the end of the pillar. Seeing this, Lord Shiva got angry and cursed Brahma that he will not be worshipped by anyone and gave Lord Vishnu the title of being supreme. Pillars of fire vanished but a small part of it still remained at Kashi in the form of the Vishwanath Jyotirlinga.</p>
